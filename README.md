# Libratus
Libratus is a [Zenphoto](http://zenphoto.org) theme that is fully responsive which looks great on desktop to mobile naturally using mobile first design.  It utilizes image and album statisitcs more heavily than other themes, although not required.  Home page has a full screen slideshow with optional images to pull (latest, random, popular, etc.).  Great theme for a site with a large image collection.
